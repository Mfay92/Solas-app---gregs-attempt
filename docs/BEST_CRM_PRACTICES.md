# The Blueprint: Building the World's Best CRM for Supported Living

**Author:** Antigravity
**For:** Matt Fay / Solas CRM

## 1. The "North Star" Philosophy 🌟
The best CRMs in this sector don't just "manage data"; they **mitigate risk** and **maximize outcomes**.
- **For Landlords:** It's about *Yield* and *Asset Protection*.
- **For Care Providers:** It's about *Service User Safety* and *CQC Compliance*.
- **For Tenants:** It's about *Stability* and *Voice*.

**Solas must bridge these three worlds.**

## 2. Essential Features (The "Must-Haves")

### A. The Property DNA 🏠
Don't just store an address. A property profile should tell a story:
- **Compliance Traffic Lights:** Red/Amber/Green status for Gas, Electric, Fire, Legionella. *If it's red, the system should scream.*
- **Void Management:** Every day empty is money lost. Show "Days Void" and "Revenue Lost" prominently.
- **HMO Licensing:** Track license capacity vs. actual occupancy.

### B. The Person-Centred Core 👤
For Supported Living, the "Tenant" is a "Service User".
- **Risk Assessments:** Digital, version-controlled, and easily accessible.
- **Support Hours:** Track commissioned hours vs. delivered hours.
- **Incident Reporting:** A streamlined flow to log incidents (falls, behavioral) that auto-notifies relevant parties.

### C. Maintenance That Moves 🛠️
- **The "Uber" of Repairs:** Tenants/Staff report an issue -> Manager approves -> Contractor accepts -> Job Done.
- **Photo Evidence:** Mandatory before/after photos for all jobs.

## 3. "Cheat Codes" to Beat the Competition 🚀

### 💡 The "Morning Coffee" Dashboard
When a user logs in, don't show them a menu. Show them **"What needs my attention today?"**
- 3 Expiring Certificates.
- 2 Overdue Rent Payments.
- 1 Unresolved Maintenance Request.

### 🧠 AI & Automation (The Secret Sauce)
- **Smart Document Parsing:** Drag and drop a Gas Certificate PDF -> AI reads the expiry date and updates the system.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyze maintenance notes to detect unhappy tenants before they complain.

### 🎨 Design Psychology
- **Color Coding:** Use color semantically. Red isn't just a color; it's a warning. Green is safety.
- **Whitespace:** Property managers are stressed. Give them a UI that breathes.

## 4. Pitfalls to Watch Out For ⚠️
- **Over-Engineering:** Don't build a feature until a user asks for it (or you *know* they need it).
- **Data Silos:** Ensure Finance talks to Maintenance (invoices) and Lettings (rent).
- **The "Click Count":** If it takes more than 3 clicks to find a phone number, it's too deep.

*Build this, and you won't just have users; you'll have fans.*
